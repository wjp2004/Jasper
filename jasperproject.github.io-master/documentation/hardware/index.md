Hardware Guide
===

Jasper is designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi (Model B) and requires some additional hardware like a wifi adapter and USB microphone. The suggested hardware is indicated below with links for further details. You may try slightly different brands/specifications of hardware, but we cannot guarantee Jasper will work on them. Jasper is not affiliated with any of the linked hardware vendors.

- [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/16525736034140563056).
- USB Microphone (we tested with [Akiro Kinobo USB Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/USB-2-0-Microphone-Recognition-Software/%20dp/B008CNZOJY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics))
- [4GB SD Card](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4813288882623522717)

- [Micro-USB Cable](http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Male-Micro-28AWG-Cable/dp/B001U3SU8U/ref=pd_sim_pc_1)
- [USB Wall Charging Adapter](https://www.google.com/search?q=USB+wall+charger)
- [Speakers that work through the Raspberry Pi audio jack (probably need to be self-powered)](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/1749789584867681205)

Assembly of the required components is straightforward. Insert the microphone, SD card, wireless adapter (if you have one), micro-USB cable, ethernet cable, and speakers into the Raspberry Pi. The USB wall charging adapter is recommended to power Jasper as a standalone device.

The ethernet cable will be used to log in to the pi from a computer during the software installation step. After installation, if you prefer to use a wireless connection, this cable can be removed.

<h3 class="linked" id='internet'><a href="#internet" title="Permalink to this headline">Internet Connection</a></h3>

As mentioned above, the wireless adapter is optional. Jasper runs just fine on a wired connection (via ethernet), so you can choose between the two setups depending on what works best for you.
