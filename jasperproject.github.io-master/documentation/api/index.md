Developer API
===

Jasper provides a dead-simple API for developers to create their own voice-controlled modules.

There are two types of modules: standard and notification. Click on either heading below to learn how to create your own.

## [Standard module](/documentation/api/standard)

The interaction here is _active_: users initiate contact with Jasper and ask it to execute some module.


## [Notification module](/documentation/api/notification)

The interaction here is _passive_: Jasper will do some silent monitoring of some information stream (e.g., checking Twitter or email) and speak when there is something important to report.
